The creation of novel technologies to support field work and research has a major impact from technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing and wearable computing. In this context, Artificial-Intelligence-based systems became more common and a trend in recent work. Environments with low connectivity and high latency in data transmission enforce the usage of Edge Computing technologies in the treatment of acquired data. Nonetheless, there is no clarity in how to transport Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Edge Computing in extreme environments, given the complexity of the requirements. This gap is more clear in the context of wearable computing, where the systems restrictions for developing systems are even harder. Thus, this work presents a protocol for developing Edge AI appliances and some case-study applications in the context of wearable devices. This study helps to evaluate the creation of Wearable Edge AI context as a novel research field.
