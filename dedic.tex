\dedication{ ``The day we cease the exploration of the cosmos is the day we threaten the continuing of our species. In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people \& nations would be prone to act on their low-contracted prejudices and would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment... until the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective. A perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above nor below, but within.'' \\ {Neil DeGrasse Tyson}}
